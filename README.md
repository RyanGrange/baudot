# baudot
Translate 7-bit ASCII characters to 5-bit Baudot or Baudot to ASCII

Status Update:  
2024-08-31 This isn't dead. It's just been a low priority for me since I don't have the same hardware as I did back in the Navy to test with and there doesn't appear to be much interest in communicating with old 5-bit teletypes anymore. (Not to mention the whole "bell" sound in what is otherwise text data.)  I'm still poking at it from time to time on my local machine.
